    "# **Traffic Sign Recognition** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "One of the essential part of bringing the autonoous vehicles on the road is to estimate the traffic signs, since without rules on the road it would be like crashing the robots in luna park.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to recognize the traffic signs thanks to latest researches. \n",
    "The very first step of recognizing something is to know what to recognize. For this purpose it is needed to pump some example traffic signs into some kind of system to teach what the system should recognize, which is called training sets. After the system knows what to recognize, we need to validate the trained system how precise the system is, while it is recognizing the inputs. At this place the inputs are the real images taken from the system, e.g. camera on board. The system observes the environment and feeds the environment through trained network to say what is the meaning of the taken input. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this puprpose in this project the algotihm is implemented to recognize the traffic signs via LeNet neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)\n",
    "* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set\n",
    "* Design, train and test a model architecture\n",
    "* Use the model to make predictions on new images\n",
    "* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",

    "\n",
    "The required datas are provided in picled form. The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'features' is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).\n",
    "- 'labels' is a 1D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file signnames.csv contains id -> name mappings for each id.\n",
    "- 'sizes' is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the original width and height the image.\n",
    "- 'coords' is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic\n",
    "signs data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is 34799\n",
    "* The size of the validation set is 4410\n",
    "* The size of test set is 12630\n",
    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32,32,3)\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is given in python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Visualization of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used matplotlib to visualize one image per unique label and a bar chart for the total number of train images with respect to its label. Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example test image per unique label is given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the images is given on bar chart as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Preprocessing of data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it will have only one channel to analyze instead of three channels, thus, it reduces the amount feature which results in better/faster computing performance. In training images there are also bad images which are really dark and hard to recognize them, so converting the image to gray scale will also help at this point to make easier recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data by mapping the pixels' values between 0 and 255 to the values between -1 and 1, using the provided formula `(pixel - 128)/ 128`, which makes the recognition better, since we work in narrower value region.\n",
